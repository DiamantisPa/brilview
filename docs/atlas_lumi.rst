ATLAS luminosity comparison
===========================

"ATLAS luminosity" component is for plotting ATLAS and BRIL luminosity on the
same chart for comparison.

Querying
--------

ATLAS luminosity can be queried by fill number. On query chart is cleared before
plotting.

When the chart contains a series of ATLAS luminosity, you may query CMS
luminosity for the same fill. When querying CMS luminosity, new series are added
on top for comparison.
